### How to view a kubernetes config file ?

To view kubernetes config file execute the below command.
```
kubectl config view
```


A `kubeconfig` file is a configuration file used by the Kubernetes command-line tool `kubectl`, to communicate with a Kubernetes cluster. It typically contains information about clusters, user authentication, and context for interacting with the cluster. The main components of a `kubeconfig` file include:

1. **Clusters:**
   - **cluster:** Defines a cluster, specifying details such as the cluster's name, server (API server URL), and optional parameters like the certificate authority (CA) for secure communication.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   clusters:
   - name: my-cluster
     cluster:
       server: https://kubernetes-api-server-url
       certificate-authority: /path/to/ca.crt
   ```

2. **Users:**
   - **user:** Describes a user and includes information needed for authentication. This may include client certificates, client keys, or token information.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   users:
   - name: my-user
     user:
       client-certificate: /path/to/client.crt
       client-key: /path/to/client.key
   ```

3. **Contexts:**
   - **context:** Defines a named context, which is a combination of a cluster, a user, and a namespace. It specifies which user and cluster should be used, and in which namespace commands should operate by default.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   contexts:
   - name: my-context
     context:
       cluster: my-cluster
       user: my-user
       namespace: my-namespace
   ```

4. **Current Context:**
   - **current-context:** Specifies the default context that `kubectl` should use when no other context is specified.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   current-context: my-context
   ```

5. **Defaults (Optional):**
   - **kind:** Specifies the kind of resource, which is usually "Config."
   - **apiVersion:** Specifies the API version for the Config resource.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   kind: Config
   apiVersion: v1
   ```

The structure of a `kubeconfig` file is hierarchical, with clusters, users, and contexts being defined at the top level. Here's a basic example combining these components:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
- name: my-cluster
  cluster:
    server: https://kubernetes-api-server-url
    certificate-authority: /path/to/ca.crt
users:
- name: my-user
  user:
    client-certificate: /path/to/client.crt
    client-key: /path/to/client.key
contexts:
- name: my-context
  context:
    cluster: my-cluster
    user: my-user
    namespace: my-namespace
current-context: my-context
```

This `kubeconfig` file would allow `kubectl` to communicate with the Kubernetes cluster using the specified user and cluster information within the "my-context" context.
